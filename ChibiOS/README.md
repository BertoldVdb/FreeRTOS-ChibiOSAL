# ChibiOS 17.6.0

This is a stripped ChibiOS. It only contains the HAL. It is included to make the example project build. Only one directory has been added to ChibiOS to support FreeRTOS: os/hal/osal/freertos/

You should be able to copy this directory to a freshly downloaded ChibiOS archive and use it.
